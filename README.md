# 👋 Hi, I'm **Kunal Vishwakarma**

### **Technical Project Manager | Datacenter SME | Cloud & Infrastructure Architect | Multimodal AI Platform Practitioner**

I design, migrate, and modernize enterprise‑scale infrastructure across Azure, hybrid cloud, and on‑prem data centers. With 20+ years of experience across regulated industries, I specialize in **cloud migration programs, secure infrastructure delivery, and technical project leadership**.

As part of my routine work as a Technical Project Manager and Infrastructure Architect, I use multimodal AI platforms to support:

• Project governance (RAID logs, risk analysis, impact assessments)
• Cloud architecture validation (Azure, hybrid cloud, security models)
• Automation of documentation, runbooks, and technical summaries
• Stakeholder communication and decision-support insights
• Process optimization across DevOps, ITSM, and cloud migration programs

AI enhances my ability to deliver faster, maintain accuracy, and ensure consistent quality across complex technical projects.
